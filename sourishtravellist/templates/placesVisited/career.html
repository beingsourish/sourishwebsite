                    <p>
                        My professional journey began in <strong>2012</strong> when I joined <strong>Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)</strong> in Kolkata, India, as a Software Engineering Trainee. This role laid the foundation of my career in software development and IT solutions.

                    <p>
                        In <strong>2015</strong>, I moved to <strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>, where I worked as a Software Developer for the <strong>California Testing Bureau (CTB)</strong>. This was my first international experience, broadening my understanding of global work environments and collaborative projects.

                    <p>
                        The following year, <strong>2016</strong>, I transitioned to <strong>Monterey, California</strong>, joining <strong>DRC (Data Recognition Corporation)</strong>. My work involved educational data systems and assessments, expanding my skills in data-driven development and large-scale applications.

                    <p>
                        In <strong>February 2017</strong>, I relocated to <strong>Tampa, Florida</strong>, to work with <strong>Verizon</strong> as a Data Engineer. I was part of a major data migration project, contributing to robust ETL pipelines and scalable infrastructure, which enhanced my expertise in data engineering and analytics.

                    <p>
                        Each city and role in my journey exposed me to new challenges, cultures, and perspectives. These diverse experiences taught me valuable life lessonsâ€”from discipline and adaptability to cultural appreciation and human connection. Traveling, working across states, and interacting with people from various backgrounds made this journey truly unforgettable.

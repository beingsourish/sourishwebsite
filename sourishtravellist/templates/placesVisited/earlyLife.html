                    <p>
                        I was born in Kolkata and spent most of my childhood in Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The islands, surrounded by nature and peace, offered a unique upbringing filled with both simplicity and richness of experience.

                        I studied at Kendriya Vidyalaya, Port Blair, where I was actively involved in sports and academics. Later, I moved to Agartala, Tripura, which gave me new perspectives and helped shape my journey further.

                        Life in the Andaman Islands taught me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of community. The simplicity of island life built my character and helped me value small things deeply.

                        After completing my schooling, I pursued engineering and stepped into the professional world, where I began working and building my career â€” carrying forward the lessons learned in my early life.

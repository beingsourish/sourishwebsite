                    <p>
                        In <strong>2015</strong>, I took a major step in my career and life by moving to the <strong>United States</strong>. My first destination was <strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>, where I joined the <strong>California Testing Bureau (CTB)</strong> as a Software Developer. It was both exciting and challenging—adjusting to a new culture, work style, and daily life far from home.

                    <p>
                        This move was more than just a job relocation—it was the beginning of a transformative life experience. I immersed myself in a multicultural environment, learned to appreciate new traditions, and built friendships with people from across the world.

                    <p>
                        Over the years, I moved across states—<strong>California</strong>, <strong>Florida</strong>—each place teaching me something new. The journey taught me independence, adaptability, and gave me the courage to step out of my comfort zone.

                    <p>
                        My time in the USA also gave me the chance to explore beautiful landscapes, meet people from different ethnic backgrounds, and understand diverse lifestyles. These moments enriched my personal and professional journey in ways I never imagined.

                    <p>
                        Looking back, the decision to move to the USA was a turning point in my life—full of growth, challenges, unforgettable memories, and a deep sense of gratitude for the opportunities that came my way.
